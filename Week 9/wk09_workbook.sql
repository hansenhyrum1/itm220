/*
    The CASE clause is the "IF" statement of SQL. 
    It allows us to match conditions and set results based on the condition met.
    This is useful for the following reasons:
        * In one column we can have a different result returned based on the condition
        * We can manipulate the output from the data to display relevant information

        Example: A boolean field in SQL is stored as a TINYINT. This causes it to be
        stored as a 1 or a 0. Using a case statement we can have the query state the
        words 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' based on if the result is 1 or 0.

        Example Query:
        --
        This query checks to see if the customer is active or not,
        then it orders by their active state, then last name
        --
        SELECT  c.customer_id
        ,       CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS customer_name
        ,       CASE 
                WHEN c.active = 1 THEN 'Active'
                ELSE 'Inactive'
                END AS status
        FROM    customer c
        ORDER BY c.active DESC, c.last_name;

-- 1. Rewrite the following query, which uses a simple CASE expression, 
-- so that the same results are achieved using a searched CASE expression. 
-- Try to use as few WHEN clauses as possible.
SELECT  name
,       CASE name
            WHEN 'English'  THEN 'latin1'
            WHEN 'Italian'  THEN 'latin1'
            WHEN 'French'   THEN 'latin1'
            WHEN 'German'   THEN 'latin1'
            WHEN 'Japanese' THEN 'utf8'
            WHEN 'Mandarin' THEN 'utf8'
            ELSE 'UNKNOWN'
        END AS character_set

-- | Italian  | latin1        |
-- | Japanese | utf8          |
-- | Mandarin | utf8          |
-- | French   | latin1        |

-- 2. Rewrite the following query so that the result set contains 
-- a single row with five columns (one for each rating). 
-- Name the five columns (G, PG, PG_13, R, and NC_17).
SELECT   rating

-- | R      |      195 |
-- +--------+----------+
-- 5 rows in set (0.54 sec)

-- 3. Write a query that returns the alphabetized first letter 
-- of the customer's last name and the count of active and inactive customers. 
-- Limit the results to only those first letters that occur in the 
-- last_name column of the customer table.

-- Label the columns as follows:

-- starts_with is the first column and the first letter of the customer's last_name.

-- active_count is the second column and the count of active customers 
--              (as defined in the textbook examples of Chapter 11).

-- inactive_count is the third column and the count of inactive customers 
--                (as defined in the textbook examples of Chapter 11).

-- 4. Write a query that returns the alphabetized first letter

-- PRACTICE
-- ----------------------------------

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. List the titles of all films and classify them according to the following rules:
--    * If the length is less than 60 minutes, label them as 'Short'
--    * If the length is between 60 and 120 minutes, label them as 'Medium'
--    * If the length is greater than 120 minutes, label them as 'Long'
--    Sort by shortest film first.
--    Columns should look like the following:
--    | Title | Film_Length_Category |
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT f.title AS "Title"
	, CASE 
		WHEN f.length < 60 THEN "Short"
		WHEN f.length >= 60 AND f.length <= 120 THEN "Medium"
		WHEN f.length > 120 THEN "Long" 
			END AS "Film_Length_Category"
FROM film f
ORDER BY f.length;

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. Create a list of customers and note indicating an 'Active' or 'Inactive' status.
--    Columns should look like the following:
--    | Customer Name | Status |
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT CONCAT(c.first_name, " ", c.last_name) AS "Customer Name"
	, CASE 
		WHEN c.active = 1 THEN "Active"
        WHEN c.active = 0 THEN "Inactive"
			END AS "Status"
FROM customer c;

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. Show the titles of all films. Include the rental_duration column too.
--    Add an additional column to classify the rental duration 
--    according to the following rules:
--    * If the rental_duration is less than 4 days, label it as 'Short Term'
--    * If the rental_duration is beween 4 and 7 days, label it as 'Standard Term'
--    * If the rental_duration is greater than 7 days, label it as 'Long Term'
--    Sort by longest duration first.
--    Columns should look like the following:
--    | Title | Rental Duration | Rental_Duration_Category |
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT f.title AS "Title"
	, f.rental_duration AS "Rental Duration"
    , CASE
		WHEN f.rental_duration < 4 THEN "Short Term"
        WHEN f.rental_duration >= 4 AND f.rental_duration <= 7 THEN "Standard Term"
        WHEN f.rental_duration > 7 THEN "Long Term"
			END AS "Rental_Duration_Category"
FROM film f
ORDER BY f.rental_duration DESC;

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 4. For each customer, calculate their total rental payment and classify them
--    according to the following rules:
--    * If the total payment is less than $50, label them as a 'Low Spender'
--    * If the total payment is between $50 and $100, label them as a 'Medium Spender'
--    * If the total payment is any higher, label them as a 'High Spender'
--    Note: This query requires a GROUP BY clause. This clause will be covered more in depth
--          in week 11. Here is the basic rule: Any column NOT in the SUM function goes
--          in the GROUP BY clause. For this question, the GROUP BY clause is formatted
--          like this:
--    GROUP BY c.customer_id
--    ,        CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)
--    Sort by low spenders first. Format the total payment with a $ in front.
--    Columns will look like the following:
--    | Customer Name | Total Payment | Spending_Category |
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
